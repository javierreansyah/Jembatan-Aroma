# Jembatan Aroma

Jembatan Aroma is a food donation platform that connects restaurants with foundations in need. As a result, our platform caters to stakeholders who are adults and older individuals, including those who may have limited familiarity with technology. To address this, we have prioritized creating a user-friendly interface, especially tailored for the older demographic.

The development of our platform is built on the React framework for the front end. Additionally, we utilize Tailwind as our CSS styling framework to streamline the process of applying styles to our HTML code efficiently. Our team collaborates using Git and GitHub to facilitate seamless cooperation during the development process. Furthermore, we have opted for Vercel as our hosting provider for the website.
